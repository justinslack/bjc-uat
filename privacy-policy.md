## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, The Budget Justice Coalition (BJC) collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. BJC's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how BJC's visitors use its website. From time to time, BJC may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to The BJC's website choose to interact with The BJC in ways that require BJC to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that The BJC gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, The BJC collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with BJC. BJC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

The BJC may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, The BJC may monitor the most popular posts and may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, The BJC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

The BJC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on The BJC's behalf or to provide services available at The BJC's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. The BJC's will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, The BJC discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when The BJC believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of The BJC, third parties or the public at large. The BJC takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, The BJC may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in The BJC's sole discretion. The BJC encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
