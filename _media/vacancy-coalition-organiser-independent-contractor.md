The Budget Justice Coalition (BJC) is a coalition of twenty civil society organisations and social movements who seek to hold government accountable for the full and equal enjoyment of socio-economic rights in South Africa. BJC activities include enhancing public knowledge and participation in South Africa’s budget and planning processes; and analysing, campaigning and mobilising the public to demand budget policies that advance social, economic and environmental justice. 


The Coalition Organiser plays a vital role in ensuring that proper systems and processes are in place to enable the coalition, the Steering Committee and sub-committees, to function efficiently and effectively. The Organiser is a pro-active, helpful individual who shares the coalition members’ passion for social justice.
The Organiser is the first point of contact for a number of specified internal and external matters and communications and is therefore a key communicator within the coalition. The Organiser will seek to encourage participation by members in the activities of the coalition, organise meetings, follow up on commitments, and provide assistance to members in the execution of their tasks within the coalition.

* Keep track of opportunities for the coalition to engage with Parliament, government departments and agencies, as well as public events and forums that the coalition or its members may be interested in (e.g. webinars, workshops, campaigns) – and communicate these to the coalition.
* Support the coordination of advocacy and other activities led by members by encouraging effective project planning and following up with responsible committees and members for updates.
* Take steps to address any concerns about project and activity progress with Manco.
* Provide assistance with logistical arrangements for meetings and other activities.
* Where agreed, represent the coalition in external meetings from time to time.
